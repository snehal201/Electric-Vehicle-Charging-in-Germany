**Project Description**
This data analytics project explores the landscape of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in Germany. It aims to create a comprehensive data pipeline to preprocess and analyze a dataset containing detailed information about fuel and EV charging stations, including their location, capacity, and operational features.

From a business perspective, the analysis uncovers insights into operational efficiency, brand performance, and geographic coverage. From a customer perspective, it highlights accessibility, charging speed, and regional availability of EV infrastructure.

The study also investigates critical issues such as uneven distribution of charging stations, integration with renewable energy sources, and charging speed. Leveraging techniques like GIS mapping, machine learning, statistical modeling, and optimization algorithms, the project identifies gaps in the existing infrastructure and proposes data-driven strategies for improvement.

**Key Analytical Questions**

Who are the top five EV charging station operators by number of charging points?
What is the average connection power in the top 10 cities?
How are charging stations distributed across German districts?
What are the year-over-year growth trends in charging station deployment?
How has the average power capacity of charging stations evolved?
